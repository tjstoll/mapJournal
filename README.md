# MapJournal - Demo

created on: oct-13-2025

## TL;DR!

Click the map to get coordinates or enter them manually. Then use the form to create your post.

## About

A map based journal that uses location to organize post entries instead of pages. It uses pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Leaflet is also used to create the map and all of its functions.

This is a very rough draft.

## Current Features

* Populate lat/long field straight from map
* Create a journal entry and open it
* Best for desktop

## Future Features

* Centre map on user's current location
* Add custom image to post
* Delete posts and markers
* Show all posts
* Add more components to post (paragraphs, images, etc.)
* Create button on post to focus on its map marker
* Make mobile friendly
* Save posts to database
